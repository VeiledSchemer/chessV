# This is a variant description file for Sjaak.
# It can be used to configure Sjaak to play a chess variant by specifying the movement mode of the pieces.
# Empty lines and anything following a # character are ignored.

# To define a variant, begin a line with "Variant: <name>", then follow on subsequent lines with descriptions
# of the board, the pieces used and their movement, and other rules used in the variant.
# There are a number of examples below, but first we'll go into some background.

# THE BOARD AND ZONES
#
# The board size is specified by (files)x(ranks), for instance
#  Board: 8x8
# defines a standard chess board. There are some limits on the size of a board: the number of files
# and ranks needs to be smaller than 16 and the total size of the board needs to be less than 128
# squares.
# For some of the rules, it's necessary to identify a part of the board. This is done by defining a "zone",
# which lists the squares on the board that are part of that zone.
# For instance:
#  Zone: rank2 = a2,b2,c2,d2,e2,f2,g2,h2
#  Zone: rank8 = a8,b8,c8,d8,e8,f8,g8,h8
# defines the 8th rank (rank8) of the board.
# Files are identified by letters, "a" being the first. Ranks are labelled by numbers, starting at "1".
# The square "a1" is in the lower-left hand side of the board.
# Two special zones, "empty" and "all", are pre-defined. As the names indicate, "empty" corresponds to an
# empty board while "all" corresponds to the entire board.
#
# It's possible to exclude certain regions of the board. Moves are never generated from or to these squares:
#  Exclude: g1,h1,g2,h2,g3,h3,g4,h4,g5,h5,g6,h6,a7,b7,c7,d7,e7,f7,g7,h7,a8,b8,c8,d8,e8,f8,g8,h8
# excludes the last two rows and the rightmost files on the board, effectively reducing the board to 6x6.
#
# For some games, the victory (or drawing!) condition can be to occupy a specific region of the board.
# This is referred to here as "capture the flag". To enable this, a special zone has to be defined for each
# player, WhiteFlag for white and BlackFlag for black:
#  WhiteFlag: e1
#  BlackFlag: e8
# The game ends when white captures and holds all black flags and vice versa.

# PIECES
#
# Piece descriptions start with a "Piece:" line. On following lines the piece move and special properties can
# be defined.

# MOVEMENT TYPES
#
# In order to define new variants, it is important to know how to specify the movement of the pieces.
# Sjaak distinguishes three types of moves:
#
# Sliders  - move along a ray direction until they encounter another piece or the edge of the board
# Leapers  - perform single steps to specified target squares
# Steppers - perform single (repeated) steps in a particular board direction
#
# Each of these moves treats the board in a slightly different way, and so the description of moves for each
# is different:
#
# Sliders move along a ray, either horizontal (H), vertical (V), diagonal (D) or anti-diaginal (A).
# Examples:
#  slide (H,V)         - describes a chess rook
#  slide (A,D)         - describes a bishop
#  slide (H,V,A,D)     - describes a queen
#
# Leaper moves can become complicated, but in their simplest form they just specify the step-vector, which is
# then mirrored to give a total of up to 8 target squares.
# Examples:
#  leap (2,1)          - describes a knight
#  leap (1,2)          - alternative description of a knight
#  leap (1,1)          - describes a ferz
#  leap (2,2)          - an elephant
#  leap (1,0)          - a wazir
#  leap (2,0)          - a dabbabah
# The complications begin when a piece is a compound leaper, meaning it can choose between different leaper
# moves. For instance, a king can move as a ferz, or as a wazir:
#  leap (1,0)|(1,1)    - a king
# However, a leaper can also be a two-step leaper, which first moves as one type of leaper and then again as
# another type of leaper:
#  leap (1,0)+(1,1)    - move as a wazir first and then as a ferz
# Typically, this is useful to define lame leapers by also specifying a mask:
#  leap ((1,0)+(1,1)) & (1,2)
# describes a piece that moves first as a wazir (only to empty squares) and then again as a ferz. However,
# the final destination must be a square that could have been reached by a knight. In other words, this
# describes a piece that moves like a knight, but can be blocked. A Xiangqi horse.
#
# For steppers, board directions are indicated by compass points, so "north" (the side of the board where
# black starts out), "south" (where white starts), "east" (the king-side, the direction of the H-file) and
# "west" (towards the A-file).
# Steppers are intended to be asymmetric (the move description is for white and mirrored for black),
#  step N              - describes a piece that moves one square "north", a white pawn
#  step S              - describes a piece that moves one square "south", a black pawn
# Optionally, the direction can be prefixed with a number (1-7):
#  step 2N             - the initial double step of a white pawn.
# Steppers are normally used to define pawns, and a number of pawn-specific evaluation terms are only
# activated for pieces that are defined as stepper moves. Steppers also have their moves generated in bulk,
# one direction at a time (as opposed to one piece at a time), which impacts performance.
#
# Finally, there are two variations to the three above movement types: hoppers and asymmetric leapers.
#
# Hoppers are sliders that need to jump over another piece before they can move.
#  hop (H,V)           - describes the capture move of a cannon in Xiangqi
# Currently, capture is replacement only. It is not possible (yet) to define a piece that captures by leaping
# over its victim.
#
# Asymmetric leapers are leapers that, as the name implies, move differently for white and black.
# Their syntax is similar to that of normal leapers, but instead of specifying the movement vector, it's
# necessary to specify each step:
#  aleap (0,1)         - a piece that moves one square north for white and one square south for black (like a pawn)
#  aleap (1,1)|(1,-1)|(-1,-1)|(-1,1)|(0,1) - a Makruk elephant or silver general
#  aleap (1,1)|(-1,1)|(1,0)|(-1,0)|(0,1)|(0,-1) - a gold general

# MOVES AND CAPTURES
#
# A piece can have more than one movement type defined for it, simply by specifying them one after the other
# on separate lines:
#
#  Move: slide (H,V,A,D)
#  Move: leap (1,2)
#
# defines the move for an Amazon. The move types must be different on each line, or the result will be
# undefined.
# If a capture move is not specified, it is assumed to be the same as the normal move. To disable captures for
# a particular piece type, specify "none":
#
#  Capture: none     # Piece cannot capture

# SPECIAL MOVES (DOUBLE PUSHES)
#
# For pieces that can perform special moves, it's necessary to specify both the move and the location on the
# board where they can make the special move. This is done by defining a zone and then referencing it from the
# piece description:
#  Special: rank2, rank7, step 2N
# defines the initial double step for a white pawn (on rank 2) and a black pawn (on rank 7).
# Special moves currently cannot be captures, and do not depend on whether the piece has moved or not.

# INITIAL MOVES (DOUBLE PUSHES, ALTERNATIVE)
#
# Initial moves are moves that can only be made by a piece that has not moved yet.
#  Initial: step 2N
# defines the initial double step for a white pawn (on rank 2) and a black pawn (on rank 7).
# Initial moves currently cannot be captures, and must be "step" moves.

# SPECIAL MOVES (CASTLING)
#
# Castling is a special move where two friendly pieces move. It is only possible if neither of the two pieces
# has moved already. All squares between the initial and final positions of the two pieces must be empty
# (apart from the two pieces themselves).
# If the primary castling piece is royal, then all squares between the king's initial and final position must
# be "safe".
# To define a castling move, specify the (default) starting position of the king, the king's destination
# square and the secondary's (default) starting position. The secondary's destination square is derived from
# the king's move: if the king moves to the king-side (east side) of the board, the secondary moves to the
# left of the king. If the king moves to the queen-side (west side) of the board the secondary moves to the
# right of the king.
# It is possible to specify multiple destination squares for the king in a comma-separated list. This defines
# a flexible form of castling where the king is allowed to move to any of the given destination squares.
# Example:
#
#  Castle: white e1-g1 with h1     # Canonical king-side castling
#  Castle: white e1-c1 with a1     # Canonical queen-side castling
#  Castle: white e1-c1,b1 with a1  # Queen-side castling, either 2-step or 3-step
#
# To define FRC-style castling, simply define the "standard" castling rule (which provide the destination
# square for the king and the default location of the rook). The FRC rule will be based on this
# and the actual specified position of the king and rook in the startup FEN.
# Behaviour is undefined if all squares are not on one rank.

# RESTRICTING MOVEMENT
#
# It is possible to restrict the movement options of a piece by specifying the locations it is allowed to move
# to:
#  Zone: white_palace = d1,e1,f1, d2,e2,f2, d3,e3,f3
#  Zone: black_palace = d8,e8,f8, d9,e9,f9, d10,e10,f10
#
#  Piece: King
#  Move: leap (0,1)
#  Symbol: "K", "K,k"
#  Flags: royal
#  Prison: white_palace, black_palace
# Defines the XiangQi king, which is only allowed to move inside the palace.
#
# Alternatively, it is possible to mark squares as unpassable by particular pieces:
#  Zone: white_centre = e4,d4
#  Zone: black_centre = e5,d5
#
#  Piece: Rook
#  Move: slide (H, V)
#  Symbol: "R", "R,r"
#  Block: white_centre, black_centre
# defines a rook that cannot move to the centre (e4/d4 for white, e5/d5 for black).

# DROPS
#
# For variants that include drops, the default rule is that pieces in-hand may be dropped anywhere on the
# board, as long as pieces are allowed to move from their new location. You can override this:
#  Drop zone: all, all
# allows pieces to be dropped everywhere, while
#  Zone: rank1 = a1,b1,c1,d1,e1,f1,g1,h1
#  Zone: rank8 = a8,b8,c8,d8,e8,f8,g8,h8
#
#  Drop zone: rank1, rank8
# restricts drops to the (own) back rank.
# Specifying the drop zone in this way implicitly sets the "drop_dead" piece property (see below).

# PROMOTIONS
#
# Pieces promote as soon as they reach their promotion zone, to one of the possible promotion choices:
#  Promotion: rank8, rank1, "QRBN"
# defines the promotion for a white pawn on rank 8 and for a black pawn on rank 1.
# A promotion choice of "+" is treated in a special way: if the piece
# symbol is "P" and it has promotion choice "+", then the piece will be
# promoted to a piece with symbol "+P". It is your responsibility to make
# sure that this piece is defined in the game!
# If capture/drop rules are used, pieces that have a symbol that starts
# with "+" will be demoted when captured.
# Example:
#  Piece: Queen
#  Move: slide (D,A,H,V)
#  Symbol: "+P", "+P,+p"
#
#  Piece: Pawn
#  Move: step N
#  Capture: step NE,NW
#  Special: rank2, rank7, step 2N
#  Symbol: " ", "P,p"
#  Flags: set_ep,take_ep
#  Promotion: rank8, rank1, "+"
#
# This example defines a Queen that will demote to Pawn when captured, and
# a Pawn whose only promotion choice is the Queen (+P).
# By default, promotion is mandatory if the piece has no legal moves from a given square, otherwise it is
# optional. You can override this rule by specifying the optional promotion zone explicitly:
#  Optional promotion: empty, empty
# makes all promotions for this piece type mandatory.

# PIECE PROPERTIES
#
# Pieces can have a number of special properties, listed on a "Flags:" line. Multiple properties can be
# specified in one line, separated by a comma. The following properties can be specified:
#
#  royal          This is a royal piece: the game is lost if a side were to lose all royal pieces.
#  set_ep         This piece sets the "en-passant" capture square when it makes a special move.
#  take_ep        This piece type can capture on the "en-passant" square.
#  drop_no_check  This piece may not be dropped to give check.
#  drop_no_mate   This piece may not be dropped to give mate (it may give check).
#  drop_one_file  This piece may not be dropped on a file that already contains a friendly piece of the same type.
#  drop_dead      This piece may be dropped even where it cannot move.
#  no_mate        This piece may not deliver mate. It may deliver check.
#  shak           This piece delivers a special "shak" check.
#  assimilate     Pieces that capture this piece promote to this piece.
#  no_retaliate   After capturing a piece with this flag, your own pieces with the flag may not becaptured the next turn.
#  endangered     This piece may not capture another endangered piece if that piece is protected.
#  iron           This piece may not be captured at all.
#  capture_flag   This piece may "capture the flag". By default, all pieces may do this.

# LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PIECES
#
# It is possible to limit the number of pieces of a particular type (by promotion) by specifying that number
# in a "Max: number" or "Max: white,black" line:
#  Max: 2
# allows only two of this piece type for white and for black. You can set a different number for white and for
# black. Pass 0 to leave this at the default (whch is 1 for royal pieces and unlimited for all other piece
# types).

# EXTRA RULES AND VICTORY CONDITIONS
#
# It's possible to specify a number of extra rule options or game-ending conditions.
# End-of-game scores can be any of "win", "loss", "draw" or "illegal".
# The following game-ending conditions can be defined:
#
#  checkmate         The enemy royal piece is under attack and cannot avoid being captured (win, loss or draw, normally win)
#  stalemate         The enemy cannot make any legal moves (win, loss or draw, normally draw)
#  repeatN           The game is declared a draw if a position occurs for the Nth time (win, loss or draw, normally draw and N = 3)
#                    Set N=0 to disable any special treatment for repetitions.
#  perpetual         As repeatN, but refers to in-check positions. If not specified defaults to "repeat" (win, loss, draw or repeat).
#  loneking          Triggered if a side has a lone king remaining and baring rules are in effect (win, loss or draw, normally loss)
#  nopieces          Triggered if the side-to-move has no pieces left (win, loss or draw, normally loss).
#  captureanyflag    Triggered when capturing any flag (win, loss or draw, normally win).
#  captureallflags   Triggered when capturing all flags (win, loss or draw, normally win).
#  movecountdraw     After the specified number of reversible moves, the game is declared a draw. Set to 0 to disable.
#
# Examples (these are the defaults):
#  Rule: checkmate = win
#  Rule: stalemate = draw
#  Rule: repeat3 = draw
#  Rule: movecountdraw = 50
#
# The following special rules can be defined:
#
#  taboo                The kings may not share a ray with no pieces between them
#  keep capture         Captured pieces are held in your hand (rather than just disappearing)
#  return capture       Captured pieces are returned to their owner's hand
#  forced capture       You must make a capture if you can
#  duplecheck           If a side has more than one king, he is assumed to be in check if all of them are attacked.
#  check any king       If there are multiple kings, attacking any one of them counts as check.
#                       Without either of the last two rules a side with more than one king can never be in check.
#  allow pickup         As a move you can take one of your non-royal pieces from the board into your hand.
#  allow drops          As a move you may place a piece from your hand on the board.
#  force drops          If you have a piece in-hand you must place one on the board.
#  gate drops           You may "gate" pieces from your hand when first moving a back-rank piece.
#  promote here         A piece that is in the promomotion zone may promote without making a move.
#  promote drop         A piece that is dropped in the promomotion zone may promote immediately.
#  special init         Special moves are only allowed if the piece has not moved before.
#  bare rule            If you have a bare king, you have one turn to bare your opponent's king in turn.
#  chase rule           Xiangqi-style chases are not allowed.
#  shak rule            Checkmate can only be given if a chain of checks leading to it contains at least one "shak" check.
#  en-passant check     Sliding royals can be checked "en-passant", that is, they cannot slide through check.
#  quiet promotion      Promotion moves must be "quiet" moves.
#  promote by move      A piece in the promotion zone can promote and move immediately as the new piece.
#  promote by capture   A piece in the promotion zone can promote only if it captures an enemy piece


# PIECE NAMES AND SYMBOLS
#
# Pieces can be assigned names and symbols.
# The piece name property is given on the "Piece:" line. It is an arbitrary
# string with no special meaning; SjaakII uses this when asked to list the
# rules and dump the internal board representation, but it is otherwise
# purely cosmetic.
# The piece symbol is set using the "Symbol:" property:
#  Symbol: "N", "N,n"
# The first string ("N") is used for the output of moves in standard
# algebraic notation (SAN), for instance "Nf3". The second string ("N,n")
# identifies the symbol by which the piece is identified in a FEN string,
# first for white and then for black. Normally, the black character is just
# the lower case version of the white character, which is in upper case,
# but Sjaak doesn't require this. The SAN character is normally the same as
# the white symbol, but again this is not required.
# There are two special symbols that have meaning when defining piece
# symbols:
# If a piece symbol starts with "+", say "+P", then this piece will demote to
# "P" when captured, and a piece "P" will promote to this piece (if it has
# promotion choice "+").
# If a piece symbol ends with "~", say "Q~", then this piece will demote to
# whichever piece type promotes to "Q~". Make sure that there is a piece
# type that lists "Q~" as a promotion option!

# PIECE VISUALISATION (XBOARD/WINBOARD)
#
# You can specify the piece graphic that is used by XBoard/WinBoard to represent the pieces in your variant.
# XBoard (4.8) uses a string of 44 (2x22) or more (4.9+) characters in length. To use the N-th image you
# simply have to replace the N-th character in the string with the symbol you assigned to the piece. The first
# set of characters are for white, the last set are for black. The last character listed is always the King.
# The default value of the string is "PNBRQFEACWMOHIJGDVLSUKpnbrqfeacwmohijgdvlsuk", where the characters
# represent the following pieces:
#   1 P=Pawn
#   2 N=Knight
#   3 B=Bishop
#   4 R=Rook
#   5 Q=Queen
#   6 F=Ferz
#   7 E=Alfil
#   8 A=Archbishop
#   9 C=Chancellor
#  10 W=Wazir
#  11 M=Man
#  12 O=Cannon
#  13 H=Nightrider
#  14 I=Dragon Horse
#  15 J=Dragon King
#  16 G=Grasshopper
#  17 D=Alternative Chancellor image
#  18 V=Falcon
#  19 L=Lance (or Amazon/Berolina pawn)
#  20 S=Snake
#  21 U=Unicorn
# For XBoard 4.9 and later:
#  22 L!=Lion
#  23 W!=Wolf 
#  24 C'=Camel 
#  25 Z'=Zebra 
#  26 Z=Wizard 
#  27 L'=Amazon (Lance duplicat without Pawn character) 
#  28 minor Lion (Lion duplicat without trading restriction) 
#
# After this follows the "promoted sequence", which is paired against the normal series:
#  p1 +P=Tokin (turban without ornament) 
#  p2 +N=Claw 
#  p3 +B=flat mitre without cross 
#  p4 +R=roofed Rook without battlements 
#  p5 +Q=turban with circle ornament (+L in Shogi) 
#  p6 +F=Sword without stripe 
#  p7 +E=alternate King (not visually different and still royal) 
#  p8 +A=alternate Queen (not visually different) 
#  p9 +C=alternate Lion (not visually different, still untradable) 
# p10 +W=Rook without battlements 
# p11 +M=lying sword without stripe 
# p12 +O=Dolphin 
# p13 +H=Sword 
# p14 +I=Leopard 
# p15 +J=lying sword 
# p16 +G=turban with star ornament 
# p17 +D=narrow Queen crown 
# p18 +V=lying narrow Queen crown 
# p19 +L=Knight (not visually different) 
# p20 +S=Elephant (not visually different) 
# p21 +U=Bishop without cross 
# p22 +L!=Gnu 
# p23 +W!=Viking helmet 
# p24 +C'=Iron General (simple helmet) 
# p25 +Z'=Champion (hoplit helmet) 
# p26 +Z=Tower 
# p27 +L'=Flying Dragon 
# And finally at the end,
# xxx K=King 
#
# If you do not use a particular bitmap, simply put "." in its place. Example:
#  XBoard pieces: "PNBRQFEACWMOHIJGDVLSUKpnbrqfeacwmohijgdvlsuk"
# When specifying the string, you can write both "XBoard" and "WinBoard".
